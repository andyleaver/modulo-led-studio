## Clockwise / Mario Bros Clock (inspiration)

- Project: “Clockwise / Mario Bros Clock” (commonly shared via Instructables and GitHub)
- Author: Jonathas Barbosa (jnthas)
- License: MIT (see `licenses/jnthas_clockwise_MIT.txt`)

**How Modulo uses this:** Modulo’s “Mario-Style Clock” demo is an independent, behavior/layer/rule-driven implementation inspired by the Clockwise concept (side-scrolling runner, jump on minute change, time display). It is not a copy of the original project’s source code unless explicitly stated in a given target pack.

## Trademarks & artwork

“Nintendo”, “Mario”, and related names/characters are trademarks of their respective owners.
This project does not claim affiliation with Nintendo.

The default assets shipped with Modulo demos are intended to be *original* “Mario-style” pixel art.
If you choose to import third-party sprites/tiles, you are responsible for ensuring you have the rights to use and redistribute them.
